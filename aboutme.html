        <p class="textBody">
            I am born and raised near Toronto, got my Bachelor of Arts at Ryerson University. I studied in the RTA School of Media for 4 years. I have always had a creative mind, which is what brought me to enroll in a UX/UI Bootcamp with the University of Toronto.

            <br><br>

            Upon graduating from Ryerson I got my first job in eCommerce & digital marketing. I was growing my career in this field when I decided to expand my knowledge set and study UX/UI to better understand the user experience. 

            <br><br>
            
            I am working on merging all my skills to ensure I can accomplish any goal in my field. There is no job too big or small that I cannot accomplish.

            <br><br>
            
            When I am not thinking about design and business, you’ll catch me at the hockey rink. Playing, watching, whatever the day brings me.

            <br><br>
            
            Let’s connect via Linkedin, or better yet sent me an email. Let’s grab bubble tea in Toronto whenever this pandemic ends.
